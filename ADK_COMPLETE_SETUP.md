# ✅ Successfully Attached Google ADK Repositories to MCP

## 🎉 What We Accomplished

### 1. **Repositories Cloned**

- ✅ **Code Repository**: `https://github.com/google/adk-python.git`
  - Location: `/workspaces/adk_dev_trial/adk-python`
  - Size: 4,779 objects (11.02 MB)
- ✅ **Documentation Repository**: `https://github.com/google/adk-docs.git`
  - Location: `/workspaces/adk_dev_trial/adk-docs`
  - Complete documentation, tutorials, and API reference

### 2. **MCP Configuration Updated**

- Updated `mcp-config.json` to include both repositories
- Filesystem server now has access to:
  - `/workspaces` (your workspace)
  - `/workspaces/adk_dev_trial/adk-python` (ADK Python code)
  - `/workspaces/adk_dev_trial/adk-docs` (ADK documentation)
- Configuration verified and working

### 3. **Complete ADK Ecosystem Access**
