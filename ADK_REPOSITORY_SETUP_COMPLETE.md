## ðŸ¤– What the AI Assistant Can Now Do

With MCP attached to the Google ADK Python repository, an AI assistant can:

### **Code Analysis & Understanding**

- Read and analyze all ADK Python source code
- Understand agent architectures and patterns
- Explain how different ADK components work together
- Review code quality and suggest improvements

### **Development Assistance**

- Help you build agents using ADK frameworks
- Suggest best practices based on existing code patterns
- Debug issues by examining relevant ADK modules
- Guide you through ADK's APIs and tools

### **Learning & Documentation**

- Explain ADK concepts with concrete code examples
- Walk through how to use specific ADK features
- Show you real implementations from the codebase
- Help understand the ADK architecture

### **Integration Help**

- Assist with integrating ADK into your projects
- Help configure authentication and deployment
- Guide you through tool creation and usage
- Support multi-agent system design

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### **Connect Your AI Client**

1. Point your AI client (Claude, etc.) to your `mcp-config.json`
2. Ensure the filesystem and GitHub servers are running
3. Start asking questions about the ADK Python repository!

### **Example Questions You Can Ask**

- "Explain how Google ADK agents work by looking at the source code"
- "Show me examples of how to create custom tools in ADK"
- "Help me understand the ADK authentication system"
- "Walk me through creating a multi-agent workflow"
- "What are the best practices for ADK agent deployment?"

## ðŸ”§ Your Current MCP Configuration

**Working Servers:**

- âœ… **Filesystem Server**: Access to ADK Python repository files
- âœ… **GitHub Server**: Access to GitHub repositories and docs

**Repository Access:**

- âœ… `/workspaces/adk_dev_trial/adk-python` (Google ADK Python)
- âœ… `/workspaces` (Your workspace files)

**Environment Variables:**

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Set for GitHub repository access
